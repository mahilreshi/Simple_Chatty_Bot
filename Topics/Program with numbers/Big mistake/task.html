<h2>Big mistake</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>A Python student is trying to write a program that gets two numbers from the user and prints the sum of those numbers. Unfortunately, something is wrong with the code and it doesn't work as expected:</p><pre><code class="language-python">first_number = input()
second_number = input()

print(first_number + second_number)</code></pre><p>Change the last line to correct the mistake!</p><p>Mind that you should change and rewrite only <strong>the last line</strong>. Write it in the box below. Don't copy the top two lines.</p>
